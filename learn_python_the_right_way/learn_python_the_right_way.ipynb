INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is intended for use as a highly\\nreliable host-to-host protocol between hosts in packet-switched computer\\ncommunication networks, and in interconnected systems of such networks.\\n\\nThis document describes the functions to be performed by the\\nTransmission Control Protocol, the program that implements it, and its\\ninterface to programs or users that require its services.\\n\\n1.1.  Motivation\\n\\n  Computer communication systems are playing an increasingly important\\n  role in military, government, and civilian environments.  This\\n  document focuses its attention primarily on military computer\\n  communication requirements, especially robustness in the presence of\\n  communication unreliability and availability in the presence of\\n  congestion, but many of these problems are found in the civilian and\\n  government sector as well.\\n\\n  As strategic and tactical computer communication networks are\\n  developed and deployed, it is essential to provide means of\\n  interconnecting them and to provide standard interprocess\\n  communication protocols which can support a broad range of\\n  applications.  In anticipation of the need for such standards, the\\n  Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering has\\n  declared the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) described herein to\\n  be a basis for DoD-wide inter-process communication protocol\\n  standardization.\\n\\n  TCP is a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol designed to\\n  fit into a layered hierarchy of protocols which support multi-network\\n  applications.  The TCP provides for reliable inter-process\\n  communication between pairs of processes in host computers attached to\\n  distinct but interconnected computer communication networks.  Very few\\n  assumptions are made as to the reliability of the communication\\n  protocols below the TCP layer.  TCP assumes it can obtain a simple,\\n  potentially unreliable datagram service from the lower level\\n  protocols.  In principle, the TCP should be able to operate above a\\n  wide spectrum of communication systems ranging from hard-wired\\n  connections to packet-switched or circuit-switched networks.\\n\\n\\n                                                                [Page 1]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nIntroduction\\n\\n\\n\\n  TCP is based on concepts first described by Cerf and Kahn in [1].  The\\n  TCP fits into a layered protocol architecture just above a basic\\n  Internet Protocol [2] which provides a way for the TCP to send and\\n  receive variable-length segments of information enclosed in internet\\n  datagram \"envelopes\".  The internet datagram provides a means for\\n  addressing source and destination TCPs in different networks.  The\\n  internet protocol also deals with any fragmentation or reassembly of\\n  the TCP segments required to achieve transport and delivery through\\n  multiple networks and interconnecting gateways.  The internet protocol\\n  also carries information on the precedence, security classification\\n  and compartmentation of the TCP segments, so this information can be\\n  communicated end-to-end across multiple networks.\\n\\n                           Protocol Layering\\n\\n                        +---------------------+\\n                        |     higher-level    |\\n                        +---------------------+\\n                        |        TCP          |\\n                        +---------------------+\\n                        |  internet protocol  |\\n                        +---------------------+\\n                        |communication network|\\n                        +---------------------+\\n\\n                                Figure 1\\n\\n  Much of this document is written in the context of TCP implementations\\n  which are co-resident with higher level protocols in the host\\n  computer.  Some computer systems will be connected to networks via\\n  front-end computers which house the TCP and internet protocol layers,\\n  as well as network specific software.  The TCP specification describes\\n  an interface to the higher level protocols which appears to be\\n  implementable even for the front-end case, as long as a suitable\\n  host-to-front end protocol is implemented.\\n\\n1.2.  Scope\\n\\n  The TCP is intended to provide a reliable process-to-process\\n  communication service in a multinetwork environment.  The TCP is\\n  intended to be a host-to-host protocol in common use in multiple\\n  networks.\\n\\n1.3.  About this Document\\n\\n  This document represents a specification of the behavior required of\\n  any TCP implementation, both in its interactions with higher level\\n  protocols and in its interactions with other TCPs.  The rest of this\\n\\n\\n[Page 2]                                                                \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                            Introduction\\n\\n\\n\\n  section offers a very brief view of the protocol interfaces and\\n  operation.  Section 2 summarizes the philosophical basis for the TCP\\n  design.  Section 3 offers both a detailed description of the actions\\n  required of TCP when various events occur (arrival of new segments,\\n  user calls, errors, etc.) and the details of the formats of TCP\\n  segments.\\n\\n1.4.  Interfaces\\n\\n  The TCP interfaces on one side to user or application processes and on\\n  the other side to a lower level protocol such as Internet Protocol.\\n\\n  The interface between an application process and the TCP is\\n  illustrated in reasonable detail.  This interface consists of a set of\\n  calls much like the calls an operating system provides to an\\n  application process for manipulating files.  For example, there are\\n  calls to open and close connections and to send and receive data on\\n  established connections.  It is also expected that the TCP can\\n  asynchronously communicate with application programs.  Although\\n  considerable freedom is permitted to TCP implementors to design\\n  interfaces which are appropriate to a particular operating system\\n  environment, a minimum functionality is required at the TCP/user\\n  interface for any valid implementation.\\n\\n  The interface between TCP and lower level protocol is essentially\\n  unspecified except that it is assumed there is a mechanism whereby the\\n  two levels can asynchronously pass information to each other.\\n  Typically, one expects the lower level protocol to specify this\\n  interface.  TCP is designed to work in a very general environment of\\n  interconnected networks.  The lower level protocol which is assumed\\n  throughout this document is the Internet Protocol [2].\\n\\n1.5.  Operation\\n\\n  As noted above, the primary purpose of the TCP is to provide reliable,\\n  securable logical circuit or connection service between pairs of\\n  processes.  To provide this service on top of a less reliable internet\\n  communication system requires facilities in the following areas:\\n\\n    Basic Data Transfer\\n    Reliability\\n    Flow Control\\n    Multiplexing\\n    Connections\\n    Precedence and Security\\n\\n  The basic operation of the TCP in each of these areas is described in\\n  the following paragraphs.\\n\\n\\n                                                                [Page 3]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nIntroduction\\n\\n\\n\\n  Basic Data Transfer:\\n\\n    The TCP is able to transfer a continuous stream of octets in each\\n    direction between its users by packaging some number of octets into\\n    segments for transmission through the internet system.  In general,\\n    the TCPs decide when to block and forward data at their own\\n    convenience.\\n\\n    Sometimes users need to be sure that all the data they have\\n    submitted to the TCP has been transmitted.  For this purpose a push\\n    function is defined.  To assure that data submitted to a TCP is\\n    actually transmitted the sending user indicates that it should be\\n    pushed through to the receiving user.  A push causes the TCPs to\\n    promptly forward and deliver data up to that point to the receiver.\\n    The exact push point might not be visible to the receiving user and\\n    the push function does not supply a record boundary marker.\\n\\n  Reliability:\\n\\n    The TCP must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or\\n    delivered out of order by the internet communication system.  This\\n    is achieved by assigning a sequence number to each octet\\n    transmitted, and requiring a positive acknowledgment (ACK) from the\\n    receiving TCP.  If the ACK is not received within a timeout\\n    interval, the data is retransmitted.  At the receiver, the sequence\\n    numbers are used to correctly order segments that may be received\\n    out of order and to eliminate duplicates.  Damage is handled by\\n    adding a checksum to each segment transmitted, checking it at the\\n    receiver, and discarding damaged segments.\\n\\n    As long as the TCPs continue to function properly and the internet\\n    system does not become completely partitioned, no transmission\\n    errors will affect the correct delivery of data.  TCP recovers from\\n    internet communication system errors.\\n\\n  Flow Control:\\n\\n    TCP provides a means for the receiver to govern the amount of data\\n    sent by the sender.  This is achieved by returning a \"window\" with\\n    every ACK indicating a range of acceptable sequence numbers beyond\\n    the last segment successfully received.  The window indicates an\\n    allowed number of octets that the sender may transmit before\\n    receiving further permission.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Page 4]                                                                \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                            Introduction\\n\\n\\n\\n  Multiplexing:\\n\\n    To allow for many processes within a single Host to use TCP\\n    communication facilities simultaneously, the TCP provides a set of\\n    addresses or ports within each host.  Concatenated with the network\\n    and host addresses from the internet communication layer, this forms\\n    a socket.  A pair of sockets uniquely identifies each connection.\\n    That is, a socket may be simultaneously used in multiple\\n    connections.\\n\\n    The binding of ports to processes is handled independently by each\\n    Host.  However, it proves useful to attach frequently used processes\\n    (e.g., a \"logger\" or timesharing service) to fixed sockets which are\\n    made known to the public.  These services can then be accessed\\n    through the known addresses.  Establishing and learning the port\\n    addresses of other processes may involve more dynamic mechanisms.\\n\\n  Connections:\\n\\n    The reliability and flow control mechanisms described above require\\n    that TCPs initialize and maintain certain status information for\\n    each data stream.  The combination of this information, including\\n    sockets, sequence numbers, and window sizes, is called a connection.\\n    Each connection is uniquely specified by a pair of sockets\\n    identifying its two sides.\\n\\n    When two processes wish to communicate, their TCP\\'s must first\\n    establish a connection (initialize the status information on each\\n    side).  When their communication is complete, the connection is\\n    terminated or closed to free the resources for other uses.\\n\\n    Since connections must be established between unreliable hosts and\\n    over the unreliable internet communication system, a handshake\\n    mechanism with clock-based sequence numbers is used to avoid\\n    erroneous initialization of connections.\\n\\n  Precedence and Security:\\n\\n    The users of TCP may indicate the security and precedence of their\\n    communication.

PHILOSOPHY\\n\\n2.1.  Elements of the Internetwork System\\n\\n  The internetwork environment consists of hosts connected to networks\\n  which are in turn interconnected via gateways.  It is assumed here\\n  that the networks may be either local networks (e.g., the ETHERNET) or\\n  large networks (e.g., the ARPANET), but in any case are based on\\n  packet switching technology.  The active agents that produce and\\n  consume messages are processes.  Various levels of protocols in the\\n  networks, the gateways, and the hosts support an interprocess\\n  communication system that provides two-way data flow on logical\\n  connections between process ports.\\n\\n  The term packet is used generically here to mean the data of one\\n  transaction between a host and its network.  The format of data blocks\\n  exchanged within the a network will generally not be of concern to us.\\n\\n  Hosts are computers attached to a network, and from the communication\\n  network\\'s point of view, are the sources and destinations of packets.\\n  Processes are viewed as the active elements in host computers (in\\n  accordance with the fairly common definition of a process as a program\\n  in execution).  Even terminals and files or other I/O devices are\\n  viewed as communicating with each other through the use of processes.\\n  Thus, all communication is viewed as inter-process communication.\\n\\n  Since a process may need to distinguish among several communication\\n  streams between itself and another process (or processes), we imagine\\n  that each process may have a number of ports through which it\\n  communicates with the ports of other processes.\\n\\n2.2.  Model of Operation\\n\\n  Processes transmit data by calling on the TCP and passing buffers of\\n  data as arguments.  The TCP packages the data from these buffers into\\n  segments and calls on the internet module to transmit each segment to\\n  the destination TCP.  The receiving TCP places the data from a segment\\n  into the receiving user\\'s buffer and notifies the receiving user.  The\\n  TCPs include control information in the segments which they use to\\n  ensure reliable ordered data transmission.\\n\\n  The model of internet communication is that there is an internet\\n  protocol module associated with each TCP which provides an interface\\n  to the local network.  This internet module packages TCP segments\\n  inside internet datagrams and routes these datagrams to a destination\\n  internet module or intermediate gateway.  To transmit the datagram\\n  through the local network, it is embedded in a local network packet.\\n\\n  The packet switches may perform further packaging, fragmentation, or\\n\\n\\n                                                                [Page 7]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nPhilosophy\\n\\n\\n\\n  other operations to achieve the delivery of the local packet to the\\n  destination internet module.\\n\\n  At a gateway between networks, the internet datagram is \"unwrapped\"\\n  from its local packet and examined to determine through which network\\n  the internet datagram should travel next.  The internet datagram is\\n  then \"wrapped\" in a local packet suitable to the next network and\\n  routed to the next gateway, or to the final destination.\\n\\n  A gateway is permitted to break up an internet datagram into smaller\\n  internet datagram fragments if this is necessary for transmission\\n  through the next network.  To do this, the gateway produces a set of\\n  internet datagrams; each carrying a fragment.  Fragments may be\\n  further broken into smaller fragments at subsequent gateways.  The\\n  internet datagram fragment format is designed so that the destination\\n  internet module can reassemble fragments into internet datagrams.\\n\\n  A destination internet module unwraps the segment from the datagram\\n  (after reassembling the datagram, if necessary) and passes it to the\\n  destination TCP.\\n\\n  This simple model of the operation glosses over many details.  One\\n  important feature is the type of service.  This provides information\\n  to the gateway (or internet module) to guide it in selecting the\\n  service parameters to be used in traversing the next network.\\n  Included in the type of service information is the precedence of the\\n  datagram.  Datagrams may also carry security information to permit\\n  host and gateways that operate in multilevel secure environments to\\n  properly segregate datagrams for security considerations.\\n\\n2.3.  The Host Environment\\n\\n  The TCP is assumed to be a module in an operating system.  The users\\n  access the TCP much like they would access the file system.  The TCP\\n  may call on other operating system functions, for example, to manage\\n  data structures.  The actual interface to the network is assumed to be\\n  controlled by a device driver module.  The TCP does not call on the\\n  network device driver directly, but rather calls on the internet\\n  datagram protocol module which may in turn call on the device driver.\\n\\n  The mechanisms of TCP do not preclude implementation of the TCP in a\\n  front-end processor.  However, in such an implementation, a\\n  host-to-front-end protocol must provide the functionality to support\\n  the type of TCP-user interface described in this document.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Page 8]                                                                \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                              Philosophy\\n\\n\\n\\n2.4.  Interfaces\\n\\n  The TCP/user interface provides for calls made by the user on the TCP\\n  to OPEN or CLOSE a connection, to SEND or RECEIVE data, or to obtain\\n  STATUS about a connection.  These calls are like other calls from user\\n  programs on the operating system, for example, the calls to open, read\\n  from, and close a file.\\n\\n  The TCP/internet interface provides calls to send and receive\\n  datagrams addressed to TCP modules in hosts anywhere in the internet\\n  system.  These calls have parameters for passing the address, type of\\n  service, precedence, security, and other control information.\\n\\n2.5.

Reliable Communication\\n\\n  A stream of data sent on a TCP connection is delivered reliably and in\\n  order at the destination.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                [Page 9]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nPhilosophy\\n\\n\\n\\n  Transmission is made reliable via the use of sequence numbers and\\n  acknowledgments.  Conceptually, each octet of data is assigned a\\n  sequence number.  The sequence number of the first octet of data in a\\n  segment is transmitted with that segment and is called the segment\\n  sequence number.  Segments also carry an acknowledgment number which\\n  is the sequence number of the next expected data octet of\\n  transmissions in the reverse direction.  When the TCP transmits a\\n  segment containing data, it puts a copy on a retransmission queue and\\n  starts a timer; when the acknowledgment for that data is received, the\\n  segment is deleted from the queue.  If the acknowledgment is not\\n  received before the timer runs out, the segment is retransmitted.\\n\\n  An acknowledgment by TCP does not guarantee that the data has been\\n  delivered to the end user, but only that the receiving TCP has taken\\n  the responsibility to do so.\\n\\n  To govern the flow of data between TCPs, a flow control mechanism is\\n  employed.  The receiving TCP reports a \"window\" to the sending TCP.\\n  This window specifies the number of octets, starting with the\\n  acknowledgment number, that the receiving TCP is currently prepared to\\n  receive.\\n\\n2.7.  Connection Establishment and Clearing\\n\\n  To identify the separate data streams that a TCP may handle, the TCP\\n  provides a port identifier.  Since port identifiers are selected\\n  independently by each TCP they might not be unique.  To provide for\\n  unique addresses within each TCP, we concatenate an internet address\\n  identifying the TCP with a port identifier to create a socket which\\n  will be unique throughout all networks connected together.\\n\\n  A connection is fully specified by the pair of sockets at the ends.  A\\n  local socket may participate in many connections to different foreign\\n  sockets.  A connection can be used to carry data in both directions,\\n  that is, it is \"full duplex\".\\n\\n  TCPs are free to associate ports with processes however they choose.\\n  However, several basic concepts are necessary in any implementation.\\n  There must be well-known sockets which the TCP associates only with\\n  the \"appropriate\" processes by some means.  We envision that processes\\n  may \"own\" ports, and that processes can initiate connections only on\\n  the ports they own.  (Means for implementing ownership is a local\\n  issue, but we envision a Request Port user command, or a method of\\n  uniquely allocating a group of ports to a given process, e.g., by\\n  associating the high order bits of a port name with a given process.)\\n\\n  A connection is specified in the OPEN call by the local port and\\n  foreign socket arguments.  In return, the TCP supplies a (short) local\\n\\n\\n[Page 10]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                              Philosophy\\n\\n\\n\\n  connection name by which the user refers to the connection in\\n  subsequent calls.  There are several things that must be remembered\\n  about a connection.  To store this information we imagine that there\\n  is a data structure called a Transmission Control Block (TCB).  One\\n  implementation strategy would have the local connection name be a\\n  pointer to the TCB for this connection.  The OPEN call also specifies\\n  whether the connection establishment is to be actively pursued, or to\\n  be passively waited for.\\n\\n  A passive OPEN request means that the process wants to accept incoming\\n  connection requests rather than attempting to initiate a connection.\\n  Often the process requesting a passive OPEN will accept a connection\\n  request from any caller.  In this case a foreign socket of all zeros\\n  is used to denote an unspecified socket.  Unspecified foreign sockets\\n  are allowed only on passive OPENs.\\n\\n  A service process that wished to provide services for unknown other\\n  processes would issue a passive OPEN request with an unspecified\\n  foreign socket.  Then a connection could be made with any process that\\n  requested a connection to this local socket.  It would help if this\\n  local socket were known to be associated with this service.\\n\\n  Well-known sockets are a convenient mechanism for a priori associating\\n  a socket address with a standard service.  For instance, the\\n  \"Telnet-Server\" process is permanently assigned to a particular\\n  socket, and other sockets are reserved for File Transfer, Remote Job\\n  Entry, Text Generator, Echoer, and Sink processes (the last three\\n  being for test purposes).  A socket address might be reserved for\\n  access to a \"Look-Up\" service which would return the specific socket\\n  at which a newly created service would be provided.  The concept of a\\n  well-known socket is part of the TCP specification, but the assignment\\n  of sockets to services is outside this specification.  (See [4].)\\n\\n  Processes can issue passive OPENs and wait for matching active OPENs\\n  from other processes and be informed by the TCP when connections have\\n  been established.  Two processes which issue active OPENs to each\\n  other at the same time will be correctly connected.  This flexibility\\n  is critical for the support of distributed computing in which\\n  components act asynchronously with respect to each other.\\n\\n  There are two principal cases for matching the sockets in the local\\n  passive OPENs and an foreign active OPENs.  In the first case, the\\n  local passive OPENs has fully specified the foreign socket.  In this\\n  case, the match must be exact.  In the second case, the local passive\\n  OPENs has left the foreign socket unspecified.  In this case, any\\n  foreign socket is acceptable as long as the local sockets match.\\n  Other possibilities include partially restricted matches.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 11]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nPhilosophy\\n\\n\\n\\n  If there are several pending passive OPENs (recorded in TCBs) with the\\n  same local socket, an foreign active OPEN will be matched to a TCB\\n  with the specific foreign socket in the foreign active OPEN, if such a\\n  TCB exists, before selecting a TCB with an unspecified foreign socket.\\n\\n  The procedures to establish connections utilize the synchronize (SYN)\\n  control flag and involves an exchange of three messages.  This\\n  exchange has been termed a three-way hand shake [3].\\n\\n  A connection is initiated by the rendezvous of an arriving segment\\n  containing a SYN and a waiting TCB entry each created by a user OPEN\\n  command.  The matching of local and foreign sockets determines when a\\n  connection has been initiated.  The connection becomes \"established\"\\n  when sequence numbers have been synchronized in both directions.\\n\\n  The clearing of a connection also involves the exchange of segments,\\n  in this case carrying the FIN control flag.\\n\\n2.8.  Data Communication\\n\\n  The data that flows on a connection may be thought of as a stream of\\n  octets.  The sending user indicates in each SEND call whether the data\\n  in that call (and any preceeding calls) should be immediately pushed\\n  through to the receiving user by the setting of the PUSH flag.\\n\\n  A sending TCP is allowed to collect data from the sending user and to\\n  send that data in segments at its own convenience, until the push\\n  function is signaled, then it must send all unsent data.  When a\\n  receiving TCP sees the PUSH flag, it must not wait for more data from\\n  the sending TCP before passing the data to the receiving process.\\n\\n  There is no necessary relationship between push functions and segment\\n  boundaries.  The data in any particular segment may be the result of a\\n  single SEND call, in whole or part, or of multiple SEND calls.\\n\\n  The purpose of push function and the PUSH flag is to push data through\\n  from the sending user to the receiving user.  It does not provide a\\n  record service.\\n\\n  There is a coupling between the push function and the use of buffers\\n  of data that cross the TCP/user interface.  Each time a PUSH flag is\\n  associated with data placed into the receiving user\\'s buffer, the\\n  buffer is returned to the user for processing even if the buffer is\\n  not filled.  If data arrives that fills the user\\'s buffer before a\\n  PUSH is seen, the data is passed to the user in buffer size units.\\n\\n  TCP also provides a means to communicate to the receiver of data that\\n  at some point further along in the data stream than the receiver is\\n\\n\\n[Page 12]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                              Philosophy\\n\\n\\n\\n  currently reading there is urgent data.  TCP does not attempt to\\n  define what the user specifically does upon being notified of pending\\n  urgent data, but the general notion is that the receiving process will\\n  take action to process the urgent data quickly.\\n\\n2.9.  Precedence and Security\\n\\n  The TCP makes use of the internet protocol type of service field and\\n  security option to provide precedence and security on a per connection\\n  basis to TCP users.  Not all TCP modules will necessarily function in\\n  a multilevel secure environment; some may be limited to unclassified\\n  use only, and others may operate at only one security level and\\n  compartment.  Consequently, some TCP implementations and services to\\n  users may be limited to a subset of the multilevel secure case.\\n\\n  TCP modules which operate in a multilevel secure environment must\\n  properly mark outgoing segments with the security, compartment, and\\n  precedence.

FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION\\n\\n3.1.  Header Format\\n\\n  TCP segments are sent as internet datagrams.  The Internet Protocol\\n  header carries several information fields, including the source and\\n  destination host addresses [2].  A TCP header follows the internet\\n  header, supplying information specific to the TCP protocol.  This\\n  division allows for the existence of host level protocols other than\\n  TCP.\\n\\n  TCP Header Format\\n\\n                                    \\n    0                   1                   2                   3   \\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 \\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |          Source Port          |       Destination Port        |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |                        Sequence Number                        |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |                    Acknowledgment Number                      |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |  Data |           |U|A|P|R|S|F|                               |\\n   | Offset| Reserved  |R|C|S|S|Y|I|            Window             |\\n   |       |           |G|K|H|T|N|N|                               |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |           Checksum            |         Urgent Pointer        |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |                    Options                    |    Padding    |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |                             data                              |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n\\n                            TCP Header Format\\n\\n          Note that one tick mark represents one bit position.\\n\\n                               Figure 3.\\n\\n  Source Port:  16 bits\\n\\n    The source port number.\\n\\n  Destination Port:  16 bits\\n\\n    The destination port number.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 15]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nFunctional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  Sequence Number:  32 bits\\n\\n    The sequence number of the first data octet in this segment (except\\n    when SYN is present).

The maintenance of a TCP\\n  connection requires the remembering of several variables.  We conceive\\n  of these variables being stored in a connection record called a\\n  Transmission Control Block or TCB.  Among the variables stored in the\\n  TCB are the local and remote socket numbers, the security and\\n  precedence of the connection, pointers to the user\\'s send and receive\\n  buffers, pointers to the retransmit queue and to the current segment.\\n  In addition several variables relating to the send and receive\\n  sequence numbers are stored in the TCB.\\n\\n    Send Sequence Variables\\n\\n      SND.UNA - send unacknowledged\\n      SND.NXT - send next\\n      SND.WND - send window\\n      SND.UP  - send urgent pointer\\n      SND.WL1 - segment sequence number used for last window update\\n      SND.WL2 - segment acknowledgment number used for last window\\n                update\\n      ISS     - initial send sequence number\\n\\n    Receive Sequence Variables\\n\\n      RCV.NXT - receive next\\n      RCV.WND - receive window\\n      RCV.UP  - receive urgent pointer\\n      IRS     - initial receive sequence number\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 19]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nFunctional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  The following diagrams may help to relate some of these variables to\\n  the sequence space.\\n\\n  Send Sequence Space\\n\\n                   1         2          3          4      \\n              ----------|----------|----------|---------- \\n                     SND.UNA    SND.NXT    SND.UNA        \\n                                          +SND.WND        \\n\\n        1 - old sequence numbers which have been acknowledged  \\n        2 - sequence numbers of unacknowledged data            \\n        3 - sequence numbers allowed for new data transmission \\n        4 - future sequence numbers which are not yet allowed  \\n\\n                          Send Sequence Space\\n\\n                               Figure 4.\\n    \\n    \\n\\n  The send window is the portion of the sequence space labeled 3 in\\n  figure 4.\\n\\n  Receive Sequence Space\\n\\n                       1          2          3      \\n                   ----------|----------|---------- \\n                          RCV.NXT    RCV.NXT        \\n                                    +RCV.WND        \\n\\n        1 - old sequence numbers which have been acknowledged  \\n        2 - sequence numbers allowed for new reception         \\n        3 - future sequence numbers which are not yet allowed  \\n\\n                         Receive Sequence Space\\n\\n                               Figure 5.\\n    \\n    \\n\\n  The receive window is the portion of the sequence space labeled 2 in\\n  figure 5.\\n\\n  There are also some variables used frequently in the discussion that\\n  take their values from the fields of the current segment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Page 20]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n    Current Segment Variables\\n\\n      SEG.SEQ - segment sequence number\\n      SEG.ACK - segment acknowledgment number\\n      SEG.LEN - segment length\\n      SEG.WND - segment window\\n      SEG.UP  - segment urgent pointer\\n      SEG.PRC - segment precedence value\\n\\n  A connection progresses through a series of states during its\\n  lifetime.  The states are:  LISTEN, SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED,\\n  ESTABLISHED, FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK,\\n  TIME-WAIT, and the fictional state CLOSED.  CLOSED is fictional\\n  because it represents the state when there is no TCB, and therefore,\\n  no connection.  Briefly the meanings of the states are:\\n\\n    LISTEN - represents waiting for a connection request from any remote\\n    TCP and port.\\n\\n    SYN-SENT - represents waiting for a matching connection request\\n    after having sent a connection request.\\n\\n    SYN-RECEIVED - represents waiting for a confirming connection\\n    request acknowledgment after having both received and sent a\\n    connection request.\\n\\n    ESTABLISHED - represents an open connection, data received can be\\n    delivered to the user.

Sequence Numbers\\n\\n  A fundamental notion in the design is that every octet of data sent\\n  over a TCP connection has a sequence number.  Since every octet is\\n  sequenced, each of them can be acknowledged.  The acknowledgment\\n  mechanism employed is cumulative so that an acknowledgment of sequence\\n  number X indicates that all octets up to but not including X have been\\n  received.  This mechanism allows for straight-forward duplicate\\n  detection in the presence of retransmission.  Numbering of octets\\n  within a segment is that the first data octet immediately following\\n  the header is the lowest numbered, and the following octets are\\n  numbered consecutively.\\n\\n  It is essential to remember that the actual sequence number space is\\n  finite, though very large.  This space ranges from 0 to 2**32 - 1.\\n  Since the space is finite, all arithmetic dealing with sequence\\n  numbers must be performed modulo 2**32.  This unsigned arithmetic\\n  preserves the relationship of sequence numbers as they cycle from\\n  2**32 - 1 to 0 again.  There are some subtleties to computer modulo\\n  arithmetic, so great care should be taken in programming the\\n  comparison of such values.  The symbol \"=<\" means \"less than or equal\"\\n  (modulo 2**32).\\n\\n  The typical kinds of sequence number comparisons which the TCP must\\n  perform include:\\n\\n    (a)  Determining that an acknowledgment refers to some sequence\\n         number sent but not yet acknowledged.\\n\\n    (b)  Determining that all sequence numbers occupied by a segment\\n         have been acknowledged (e.g., to remove the segment from a\\n         retransmission queue).\\n\\n    (c)  Determining that an incoming segment contains sequence numbers\\n         which are expected (i.e., that the segment \"overlaps\" the\\n         receive window).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Page 24]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  In response to sending data the TCP will receive acknowledgments.

Due to zero\\n  windows and zero length segments, we have four cases for the\\n  acceptability of an incoming segment:\\n\\n    Segment Receive  Test\\n    Length  Window\\n    ------- -------  -------------------------------------------\\n\\n       0       0     SEG.SEQ = RCV.NXT\\n\\n       0      >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND\\n\\n      >0       0     not acceptable\\n\\n      >0      >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND\\n                  or RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND\\n\\n  Note that when the receive window is zero no segments should be\\n  acceptable except ACK segments.  Thus, it is be possible for a TCP to\\n  maintain a zero receive window while transmitting data and receiving\\n  ACKs.  However, even when the receive window is zero, a TCP must\\n  process the RST and URG fields of all incoming segments.\\n\\n  We have taken advantage of the numbering scheme to protect certain\\n  control information as well.  This is achieved by implicitly including\\n  some control flags in the sequence space so they can be retransmitted\\n  and acknowledged without confusion (i.e., one and only one copy of the\\n  control will be acted upon).  Control information is not physically\\n  carried in the segment data space.  Consequently, we must adopt rules\\n  for implicitly assigning sequence numbers to control.  The SYN and FIN\\n  are the only controls requiring this protection, and these controls\\n  are used only at connection opening and closing.  For sequence number\\n  purposes, the SYN is considered to occur before the first actual data\\n  octet of the segment in which it occurs, while the FIN is considered\\n  to occur after the last actual data octet in a segment in which it\\n  occurs.  The segment length (SEG.LEN) includes both data and sequence\\n  space occupying controls.  When a SYN is present then SEG.SEQ is the\\n  sequence number of the SYN.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Page 26]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  Initial Sequence Number Selection\\n\\n  The protocol places no restriction on a particular connection being\\n  used over and over again.  A connection is defined by a pair of\\n  sockets.  New instances of a connection will be referred to as\\n  incarnations of the connection.  The problem that arises from this is\\n  -- \"how does the TCP identify duplicate segments from previous\\n  incarnations of the connection?\"  This problem becomes apparent if the\\n  connection is being opened and closed in quick succession, or if the\\n  connection breaks with loss of memory and is then reestablished.\\n\\n  To avoid confusion we must prevent segments from one incarnation of a\\n  connection from being used while the same sequence numbers may still\\n  be present in the network from an earlier incarnation.  We want to\\n  assure this, even if a TCP crashes and loses all knowledge of the\\n  sequence numbers it has been using.  When new connections are created,\\n  an initial sequence number (ISN) generator is employed which selects a\\n  new 32 bit ISN.  The generator is bound to a (possibly fictitious) 32\\n  bit clock whose low order bit is incremented roughly every 4\\n  microseconds.  Thus, the ISN cycles approximately every 4.55 hours.\\n  Since we assume that segments will stay in the network no more than\\n  the Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL) and that the MSL is less than 4.55\\n  hours we can reasonably assume that ISN\\'s will be unique.\\n\\n  For each connection there is a send sequence number and a receive\\n  sequence number.  The initial send sequence number (ISS) is chosen by\\n  the data sending TCP, and the initial receive sequence number (IRS) is\\n  learned during the connection establishing procedure.\\n\\n  For a connection to be established or initialized, the two TCPs must\\n  synchronize on each other\\'s initial sequence numbers.  This is done in\\n  an exchange of connection establishing segments carrying a control bit\\n  called \"SYN\" (for synchronize) and the initial sequence numbers.  As a\\n  shorthand, segments carrying the SYN bit are also called \"SYNs\".\\n  Hence, the solution requires a suitable mechanism for picking an\\n  initial sequence number and a slightly involved handshake to exchange\\n  the ISN\\'s.\\n\\n  The synchronization requires each side to send it\\'s own initial\\n  sequence number and to receive a confirmation of it in acknowledgment\\n  from the other side.  Each side must also receive the other side\\'s\\n  initial sequence number and send a confirming acknowledgment.\\n\\n    1) A --> B  SYN my sequence number is X\\n    2) A <-- B  ACK your sequence number is X\\n    3) A <-- B  SYN my sequence number is Y\\n    4) A --> B  ACK your sequence number is Y\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 27]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nFunctional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  Because steps 2 and 3 can be combined in a single message this is\\n  called the three way (or three message) handshake.\\n\\n  A three way handshake is necessary because sequence numbers are not\\n  tied to a global clock in the network, and TCPs may have different\\n  mechanisms for picking the ISN\\'s.  The receiver of the first SYN has\\n  no way of knowing whether the segment was an old delayed one or not,\\n  unless it remembers the last sequence number used on the connection\\n  (which is not always possible), and so it must ask the sender to\\n  verify this SYN.  The three way handshake and the advantages of a\\n  clock-driven scheme are discussed in [3].\\n\\n  Knowing When to Keep Quiet\\n\\n  To be sure that a TCP does not create a segment that carries a\\n  sequence number which may be duplicated by an old segment remaining in\\n  the network, the TCP must keep quiet for a maximum segment lifetime\\n  (MSL) before assigning any sequence numbers upon starting up or\\n  recovering from a crash in which memory of sequence numbers in use was\\n  lost.  For this specification the MSL is taken to be 2 minutes.  This\\n  is an engineering choice, and may be changed if experience indicates\\n  it is desirable to do so.  Note that if a TCP is reinitialized in some\\n  sense, yet retains its memory of sequence numbers in use, then it need\\n  not wait at all; it must only be sure to use sequence numbers larger\\n  than those recently used.\\n\\n  The TCP Quiet Time Concept\\n\\n    This specification provides that hosts which \"crash\" without\\n    retaining any knowledge of the last sequence numbers transmitted on\\n    each active (i.e., not closed) connection shall delay emitting any\\n    TCP segments for at least the agreed Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL)\\n    in the internet system of which the host is a part.  In the\\n    paragraphs below, an explanation for this specification is given.\\n    TCP implementors may violate the \"quiet time\" restriction, but only\\n    at the risk of causing some old data to be accepted as new or new\\n    data rejected as old duplicated by some receivers in the internet\\n    system.\\n\\n    TCPs consume sequence number space each time a segment is formed and\\n    entered into the network output queue at a source host. The\\n    duplicate detection and sequencing algorithm in the TCP protocol\\n    relies on the unique binding of segment data to sequence space to\\n    the extent that sequence numbers will not cycle through all 2**32\\n    values before the segment data bound to those sequence numbers has\\n    been delivered and acknowledged by the receiver and all duplicate\\n    copies of the segments have \"drained\" from the internet.  Without\\n    such an assumption, two distinct TCP segments could conceivably be\\n\\n\\n[Page 28]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n    assigned the same or overlapping sequence numbers, causing confusion\\n    at the receiver as to which data is new and which is old.  Remember\\n    that each segment is bound to as many consecutive sequence numbers\\n    as there are octets of data in the segment.\\n\\n    Under normal conditions, TCPs keep track of the next sequence number\\n    to emit and the oldest awaiting acknowledgment so as to avoid\\n    mistakenly using a sequence number over before its first use has\\n    been acknowledged.  This alone does not guarantee that old duplicate\\n    data is drained from the net, so the sequence space has been made\\n    very large to reduce the probability that a wandering duplicate will\\n    cause trouble upon arrival.  At 2 megabits/sec. it takes 4.5 hours\\n    to use up 2**32 octets of sequence space.  Since the maximum segment\\n    lifetime in the net is not likely to exceed a few tens of seconds,\\n    this is deemed ample protection for foreseeable nets, even if data\\n    rates escalate to l0\\'s of megabits/sec.  At 100 megabits/sec, the\\n    cycle time is 5.4 minutes which may be a little short, but still\\n    within reason.\\n\\n    The basic duplicate detection and sequencing algorithm in TCP can be\\n    defeated, however, if a source TCP does not have any memory of the\\n    sequence numbers it last used on a given connection. For example, if\\n    the TCP were to start all connections with sequence number 0, then\\n    upon crashing and restarting, a TCP might re-form an earlier\\n    connection (possibly after half-open connection resolution) and emit\\n    packets with sequence numbers identical to or overlapping with\\n    packets still in the network which were emitted on an earlier\\n    incarnation of the same connection.  In the absence of knowledge\\n    about the sequence numbers used on a particular connection, the TCP\\n    specification recommends that the source delay for MSL seconds\\n    before emitting segments on the connection, to allow time for\\n    segments from the earlier connection incarnation to drain from the\\n    system.\\n\\n    Even hosts which can remember the time of day and used it to select\\n    initial sequence number values are not immune from this problem\\n    (i.e., even if time of day is used to select an initial sequence\\n    number for each new connection incarnation).\\n\\n    Suppose, for example, that a connection is opened starting with\\n    sequence number S.  Suppose that this connection is not used much\\n    and that eventually the initial sequence number function (ISN(t))\\n    takes on a value equal to the sequence number, say S1, of the last\\n    segment sent by this TCP on a particular connection.  Now suppose,\\n    at this instant, the host crashes, recovers, and establishes a new\\n    incarnation of the connection. The initial sequence number chosen is\\n    S1 = ISN(t) -- last used sequence number on old incarnation of\\n    connection!  If the recovery occurs quickly enough, any old\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 29]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nFunctional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n    duplicates in the net bearing sequence numbers in the neighborhood\\n    of S1 may arrive and be treated as new packets by the receiver of\\n    the new incarnation of the connection.\\n\\n    The problem is that the recovering host may not know for how long it\\n    crashed nor does it know whether there are still old duplicates in\\n    the system from earlier connection incarnations.\\n\\n    One way to deal with this problem is to deliberately delay emitting\\n    segments for one MSL after recovery from a crash- this is the \"quite\\n    time\" specification.  Hosts which prefer to avoid waiting are\\n    willing to risk possible confusion of old and new packets at a given\\n    destination may choose not to wait for the \"quite time\".\\n    Implementors may provide TCP users with the ability to select on a\\n    connection by connection basis whether to wait after a crash, or may\\n    informally implement the \"quite time\" for all connections.\\n    Obviously, even where a user selects to \"wait,\" this is not\\n    necessary after the host has been \"up\" for at least MSL seconds.\\n\\n    To summarize: every segment emitted occupies one or more sequence\\n    numbers in the sequence space, the numbers occupied by a segment are\\n    \"busy\" or \"in use\" until MSL seconds have passed, upon crashing a\\n    block of space-time is occupied by the octets of the last emitted\\n    segment, if a new connection is started too soon and uses any of the\\n    sequence numbers in the space-time footprint of the last segment of\\n    the previous connection incarnation, there is a potential sequence\\n    number overlap area which could cause confusion at the receiver.\\n\\n3.4.  Establishing a connection\\n\\n  The \"three-way handshake\" is the procedure used to establish a\\n  connection.  This procedure normally is initiated by one TCP and\\n  responded to by another TCP.  The procedure also works if two TCP\\n  simultaneously initiate the procedure.  When simultaneous attempt\\n  occurs, each TCP receives a \"SYN\" segment which carries no\\n  acknowledgment after it has sent a \"SYN\".  Of course, the arrival of\\n  an old duplicate \"SYN\" segment can potentially make it appear, to the\\n  recipient, that a simultaneous connection initiation is in progress.\\n  Proper use of \"reset\" segments can disambiguate these cases.\\n\\n  Several examples of connection initiation follow.  Although these\\n  examples do not show connection synchronization using data-carrying\\n  segments, this is perfectly legitimate, so long as the receiving TCP\\n  doesn\\'t deliver the data to the user until it is clear the data is\\n  valid (i.e., the data must be buffered at the receiver until the\\n  connection reaches the ESTABLISHED state).  The three-way handshake\\n  reduces the possibility of false connections.  It is the\\n\\n\\n\\n[Page 30]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  implementation of a trade-off between memory and messages to provide\\n  information for this checking.\\n\\n  The simplest three-way handshake is shown in figure 7 below.

At line 3, an old duplicate SYN arrives at TCP B.  TCP B\\n  cannot tell that this is an old duplicate, so it responds normally\\n  (line 4).  TCP A detects that the ACK field is incorrect and returns a\\n  RST (reset) with its SEQ field selected to make the segment\\n  believable.  TCP B, on receiving the RST, returns to the LISTEN state.\\n  When the original SYN (pun intended) finally arrives at line 6, the\\n  synchronization proceeds normally.  If the SYN at line 6 had arrived\\n  before the RST, a more complex exchange might have occurred with RST\\'s\\n  sent in both directions.\\n\\n  Half-Open Connections and Other Anomalies\\n\\n  An established connection is said to be  \"half-open\" if one of the\\n  TCPs has closed or aborted the connection at its end without the\\n  knowledge of the other, or if the two ends of the connection have\\n  become desynchronized owing to a crash that resulted in loss of\\n  memory.  Such connections will automatically become reset if an\\n  attempt is made to send data in either direction.  However, half-open\\n  connections are expected to be unusual, and the recovery procedure is\\n  mildly involved.\\n\\n  If at site A the connection no longer exists, then an attempt by the\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 33]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nFunctional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  user at site B to send any data on it will result in the site B TCP\\n  receiving a reset control message.  Such a message indicates to the\\n  site B TCP that something is wrong, and it is expected to abort the\\n  connection.\\n\\n  Assume that two user processes A and B are communicating with one\\n  another when a crash occurs causing loss of memory to A\\'s TCP.\\n  Depending on the operating system supporting A\\'s TCP, it is likely\\n  that some error recovery mechanism exists.  When the TCP is up again,\\n  A is likely to start again from the beginning or from a recovery\\n  point.  As a result, A will probably try to OPEN the connection again\\n  or try to SEND on the connection it believes open.  In the latter\\n  case, it receives the error message \"connection not open\" from the\\n  local (A\\'s) TCP.  In an attempt to establish the connection, A\\'s TCP\\n  will send a segment containing SYN.  This scenario leads to the\\n  example shown in figure 10.  After TCP A crashes, the user attempts to\\n  re-open the connection.

A reset\\n  must not be sent if it is not clear that this is the case.\\n\\n  There are three groups of states:\\n\\n    1.  If the connection does not exist (CLOSED) then a reset is sent\\n    in response to any incoming segment except another reset.  In\\n    particular, SYNs addressed to a non-existent connection are rejected\\n    by this means.\\n\\n    If the incoming segment has an ACK field, the reset takes its\\n    sequence number from the ACK field of the segment, otherwise the\\n    reset has sequence number zero and the ACK field is set to the sum\\n    of the sequence number and segment length of the incoming segment.\\n    The connection remains in the CLOSED state.\\n\\n    2.  If the connection is in any non-synchronized state (LISTEN,\\n    SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED), and the incoming segment acknowledges\\n    something not yet sent (the segment carries an unacceptable ACK), or\\n    if an incoming segment has a security level or compartment which\\n    does not exactly match the level and compartment requested for the\\n    connection, a reset is sent.\\n\\n    If our SYN has not been acknowledged and the precedence level of the\\n    incoming segment is higher than the precedence level requested then\\n    either raise the local precedence level (if allowed by the user and\\n    the system) or send a reset; or if the precedence level of the\\n    incoming segment is lower than the precedence level requested then\\n    continue as if the precedence matched exactly (if the remote TCP\\n    cannot raise the precedence level to match ours this will be\\n    detected in the next segment it sends, and the connection will be\\n    terminated then).  If our SYN has been acknowledged (perhaps in this\\n    incoming segment) the precedence level of the incoming segment must\\n    match the local precedence level exactly, if it does not a reset\\n    must be sent.\\n\\n    If the incoming segment has an ACK field, the reset takes its\\n    sequence number from the ACK field of the segment, otherwise the\\n    reset has sequence number zero and the ACK field is set to the sum\\n    of the sequence number and segment length of the incoming segment.\\n    The connection remains in the same state.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Page 36]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n    3.  If the connection is in a synchronized state (ESTABLISHED,\\n    FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK, TIME-WAIT),\\n    any unacceptable segment (out of window sequence number or\\n    unacceptible acknowledgment number) must elicit only an empty\\n    acknowledgment segment containing the current send-sequence number\\n    and an acknowledgment indicating the next sequence number expected\\n    to be received, and the connection remains in the same state.\\n\\n    If an incoming segment has a security level, or compartment, or\\n    precedence which does not exactly match the level, and compartment,\\n    and precedence requested for the connection,a reset is sent and\\n    connection goes to the CLOSED state.  The reset takes its sequence\\n    number from the ACK field of the incoming segment.\\n\\n  Reset Processing\\n\\n  In all states except SYN-SENT, all reset (RST) segments are validated\\n  by checking their SEQ-fields.  A reset is valid if its sequence number\\n  is in the window.  In the SYN-SENT state (a RST received in response\\n  to an initial SYN), the RST is acceptable if the ACK field\\n  acknowledges the SYN.\\n\\n  The receiver of a RST first validates it, then changes state.  If the\\n  receiver was in the LISTEN state, it ignores it.  If the receiver was\\n  in SYN-RECEIVED state and had previously been in the LISTEN state,\\n  then the receiver returns to the LISTEN state, otherwise the receiver\\n  aborts the connection and goes to the CLOSED state.  If the receiver\\n  was in any other state, it aborts the connection and advises the user\\n  and goes to the CLOSED state.\\n\\n3.5.  Closing a Connection\\n\\n  CLOSE is an operation meaning \"I have no more data to send.\"  The\\n  notion of closing a full-duplex connection is subject to ambiguous\\n  interpretation, of course, since it may not be obvious how to treat\\n  the receiving side of the connection.  We have chosen to treat CLOSE\\n  in a simplex fashion.  The user who CLOSEs may continue to RECEIVE\\n  until he is told that the other side has CLOSED also.  Thus, a program\\n  could initiate several SENDs followed by a CLOSE, and then continue to\\n  RECEIVE until signaled that a RECEIVE failed because the other side\\n  has CLOSED.  We assume that the TCP will signal a user, even if no\\n  RECEIVEs are outstanding, that the other side has closed, so the user\\n  can terminate his side gracefully.  A TCP will reliably deliver all\\n  buffers SENT before the connection was CLOSED so a user who expects no\\n  data in return need only wait to hear the connection was CLOSED\\n  successfully to know that all his data was received at the destination\\n  TCP.  Users must keep reading connections they close for sending until\\n  the TCP says no more data.\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 37]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nFunctional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  There are essentially three cases:\\n\\n    1) The user initiates by telling the TCP to CLOSE the connection\\n\\n    2) The remote TCP initiates by sending a FIN control signal\\n\\n    3) Both users CLOSE simultaneously\\n\\n  Case 1:  Local user initiates the close\\n\\n    In this case, a FIN segment can be constructed and placed on the\\n    outgoing segment queue.  No further SENDs from the user will be\\n    accepted by the TCP, and it enters the FIN-WAIT-1 state.  RECEIVEs\\n    are allowed in this state.  All segments preceding and including FIN\\n    will be retransmitted until acknowledged.  When the other TCP has\\n    both acknowledged the FIN and sent a FIN of its own, the first TCP\\n    can ACK this FIN.  Note that a TCP receiving a FIN will ACK but not\\n    send its own FIN until its user has CLOSED the connection also.\\n\\n  Case 2:  TCP receives a FIN from the network\\n\\n    If an unsolicited FIN arrives from the network, the receiving TCP\\n    can ACK it and tell the user that the connection is closing.  The\\n    user will respond with a CLOSE, upon which the TCP can send a FIN to\\n    the other TCP after sending any remaining data.  The TCP then waits\\n    until its own FIN is acknowledged whereupon it deletes the\\n    connection.  If an ACK is not forthcoming, after the user timeout\\n    the connection is aborted and the user is told.\\n\\n  Case 3:  both users close simultaneously\\n\\n    A simultaneous CLOSE by users at both ends of a connection causes\\n    FIN segments to be exchanged.  When all segments preceding the FINs\\n    have been processed and acknowledged, each TCP can ACK the FIN it\\n    has received.  Both will, upon receiving these ACKs, delete the\\n    connection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Page 38]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n      TCP A                                                TCP B\\n\\n  1.

Precedence and Security\\n\\n  The intent is that connection be allowed only between ports operating\\n  with exactly the same security and compartment values and at the\\n  higher of the precedence level requested by the two ports.\\n\\n  The precedence and security parameters used in TCP are exactly those\\n  defined in the Internet Protocol (IP) [2].  Throughout this TCP\\n  specification the term \"security/compartment\" is intended to indicate\\n  the security parameters used in IP including security, compartment,\\n  user group, and handling restriction.\\n\\n  A connection attempt with mismatched security/compartment values or a\\n  lower precedence value must be rejected by sending a reset.  Rejecting\\n  a connection due to too low a precedence only occurs after an\\n  acknowledgment of the SYN has been received.\\n\\n  Note that TCP modules which operate only at the default value of\\n  precedence will still have to check the precedence of incoming\\n  segments and possibly raise the precedence level they use on the\\n  connection.\\n\\n  The security paramaters may be used even in a non-secure environment\\n  (the values would indicate unclassified data), thus hosts in\\n  non-secure environments must be prepared to receive the security\\n  parameters, though they need not send them.\\n\\n3.7.  Data Communication\\n\\n  Once the connection is established data is communicated by the\\n  exchange of segments.  Because segments may be lost due to errors\\n  (checksum test failure), or network congestion, TCP uses\\n  retransmission (after a timeout) to ensure delivery of every segment.\\n  Duplicate segments may arrive due to network or TCP retransmission.\\n  As discussed in the section on sequence numbers the TCP performs\\n  certain tests on the sequence and acknowledgment numbers in the\\n  segments to verify their acceptability.\\n\\n  The sender of data keeps track of the next sequence number to use in\\n  the variable SND.NXT.  The receiver of data keeps track of the next\\n  sequence number to expect in the variable RCV.NXT.  The sender of data\\n  keeps track of the oldest unacknowledged sequence number in the\\n  variable SND.UNA.  If the data flow is momentarily idle and all data\\n  sent has been acknowledged then the three variables will be equal.\\n\\n  When the sender creates a segment and transmits it the sender advances\\n  SND.NXT.  When the receiver accepts a segment it advances RCV.NXT and\\n  sends an acknowledgment.  When the data sender receives an\\n\\n\\n[Page 40]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  acknowledgment it advances SND.UNA.  The extent to which the values of\\n  these variables differ is a measure of the delay in the communication.\\n  The amount by which the variables are advanced is the length of the\\n  data in the segment.  Note that once in the ESTABLISHED state all\\n  segments must carry current acknowledgment information.\\n\\n  The CLOSE user call implies a push function, as does the FIN control\\n  flag in an incoming segment.\\n\\n  Retransmission Timeout\\n\\n  Because of the variability of the networks that compose an\\n  internetwork system and the wide range of uses of TCP connections the\\n  retransmission timeout must be dynamically determined.  One procedure\\n  for determining a retransmission time out is given here as an\\n  illustration.\\n\\n    An Example Retransmission Timeout Procedure\\n\\n      Measure the elapsed time between sending a data octet with a\\n      particular sequence number and receiving an acknowledgment that\\n      covers that sequence number (segments sent do not have to match\\n      segments received).  This measured elapsed time is the Round Trip\\n      Time (RTT).  Next compute a Smoothed Round Trip Time (SRTT) as:\\n\\n        SRTT = ( ALPHA * SRTT ) + ((1-ALPHA) * RTT)\\n\\n      and based on this, compute the retransmission timeout (RTO) as:\\n\\n        RTO = min[UBOUND,max[LBOUND,(BETA*SRTT)]]\\n\\n      where UBOUND is an upper bound on the timeout (e.g., 1 minute),\\n      LBOUND is a lower bound on the timeout (e.g., 1 second), ALPHA is\\n      a smoothing factor (e.g., .8 to .9), and BETA is a delay variance\\n      factor (e.g., 1.3 to 2.0).\\n\\n  The Communication of Urgent Information\\n\\n  The objective of the TCP urgent mechanism is to allow the sending user\\n  to stimulate the receiving user to accept some urgent data and to\\n  permit the receiving TCP to indicate to the receiving user when all\\n  the currently known urgent data has been received by the user.\\n\\n  This mechanism permits a point in the data stream to be designated as\\n  the end of urgent information.  Whenever this point is in advance of\\n  the receive sequence number (RCV.NXT) at the receiving TCP, that TCP\\n  must tell the user to go into \"urgent mode\"; when the receive sequence\\n  number catches up to the urgent pointer, the TCP must tell user to go\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 41]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nFunctional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  into \"normal mode\".  If the urgent pointer is updated while the user\\n  is in \"urgent mode\", the update will be invisible to the user.\\n\\n  The method employs a urgent field which is carried in all segments\\n  transmitted.  The URG control flag indicates that the urgent field is\\n  meaningful and must be added to the segment sequence number to yield\\n  the urgent pointer.  The absence of this flag indicates that there is\\n  no urgent data outstanding.\\n\\n  To send an urgent indication the user must also send at least one data\\n  octet.  If the sending user also indicates a push, timely delivery of\\n  the urgent information to the destination process is enhanced.\\n\\n  Managing the Window\\n\\n  The window sent in each segment indicates the range of sequence\\n  numbers the sender of the window (the data receiver) is currently\\n  prepared to accept.  There is an assumption that this is related to\\n  the currently available data buffer space available for this\\n  connection.\\n\\n  Indicating a large window encourages transmissions.  If more data\\n  arrives than can be accepted, it will be discarded.  This will result\\n  in excessive retransmissions, adding unnecessarily to the load on the\\n  network and the TCPs.  Indicating a small window may restrict the\\n  transmission of data to the point of introducing a round trip delay\\n  between each new segment transmitted.\\n\\n  The mechanisms provided allow a TCP to advertise a large window and to\\n  subsequently advertise a much smaller window without having accepted\\n  that much data.  This, so called \"shrinking the window,\" is strongly\\n  discouraged.  The robustness principle dictates that TCPs will not\\n  shrink the window themselves, but will be prepared for such behavior\\n  on the part of other TCPs.\\n\\n  The sending TCP must be prepared to accept from the user and send at\\n  least one octet of new data even if the send window is zero.  The\\n  sending TCP must regularly retransmit to the receiving TCP even when\\n  the window is zero.  Two minutes is recommended for the retransmission\\n  interval when the window is zero.  This retransmission is essential to\\n  guarantee that when either TCP has a zero window the re-opening of the\\n  window will be reliably reported to the other.\\n\\n  When the receiving TCP has a zero window and a segment arrives it must\\n  still send an acknowledgment showing its next expected sequence number\\n  and current window (zero).\\n\\n  The sending TCP packages the data to be transmitted into segments\\n\\n\\n[Page 42]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n  which fit the current window, and may repackage segments on the\\n  retransmission queue.  Such repackaging is not required, but may be\\n  helpful.\\n\\n  In a connection with a one-way data flow, the window information will\\n  be carried in acknowledgment segments that all have the same sequence\\n  number so there will be no way to reorder them if they arrive out of\\n  order.  This is not a serious problem, but it will allow the window\\n  information to be on occasion temporarily based on old reports from\\n  the data receiver.  A refinement to avoid this problem is to act on\\n  the window information from segments that carry the highest\\n  acknowledgment number (that is segments with acknowledgment number\\n  equal or greater than the highest previously received).\\n\\n  The window management procedure has significant influence on the\\n  communication performance.  The following comments are suggestions to\\n  implementers.\\n\\n    Window Management Suggestions\\n\\n      Allocating a very small window causes data to be transmitted in\\n      many small segments when better performance is achieved using\\n      fewer large segments.\\n\\n      One suggestion for avoiding small windows is for the receiver to\\n      defer updating a window until the additional allocation is at\\n      least X percent of the maximum allocation possible for the\\n      connection (where X might be 20 to 40).\\n\\n      Another suggestion is for the sender to avoid sending small\\n      segments by waiting until the window is large enough before\\n      sending data.  If the the user signals a push function then the\\n      data must be sent even if it is a small segment.\\n\\n      Note that the acknowledgments should not be delayed or unnecessary\\n      retransmissions will result.  One strategy would be to send an\\n      acknowledgment when a small segment arrives (with out updating the\\n      window information), and then to send another acknowledgment with\\n      new window information when the window is larger.\\n\\n      The segment sent to probe a zero window may also begin a break up\\n      of transmitted data into smaller and smaller segments.  If a\\n      segment containing a single data octet sent to probe a zero window\\n      is accepted, it consumes one octet of the window now available.\\n      If the sending TCP simply sends as much as it can whenever the\\n      window is non zero, the transmitted data will be broken into\\n      alternating big and small segments.  As time goes on, occasional\\n      pauses in the receiver making window allocation available will\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 43]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nFunctional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n      result in breaking the big segments into a small and not quite so\\n      big pair. And after a while the data transmission will be in\\n      mostly small segments.\\n\\n      The suggestion here is that the TCP implementations need to\\n      actively attempt to combine small window allocations into larger\\n      windows, since the mechanisms for managing the window tend to lead\\n      to many small windows in the simplest minded implementations.\\n\\n3.8.  Interfaces\\n\\n  There are of course two interfaces of concern:  the user/TCP interface\\n  and the TCP/lower-level interface.  We have a fairly elaborate model\\n  of the user/TCP interface, but the interface to the lower level\\n  protocol module is left unspecified here, since it will be specified\\n  in detail by the specification of the lowel level protocol.  For the\\n  case that the lower level is IP we note some of the parameter values\\n  that TCPs might use.\\n\\n  User/TCP Interface\\n\\n    The following functional description of user commands to the TCP is,\\n    at best, fictional, since every operating system will have different\\n    facilities.  Consequently, we must warn readers that different TCP\\n    implementations may have different user interfaces.  However, all\\n    TCPs must provide a certain minimum set of services to guarantee\\n    that all TCP implementations can support the same protocol\\n    hierarchy.  This section specifies the functional interfaces\\n    required of all TCP implementations.\\n\\n    TCP User Commands\\n\\n      The following sections functionally characterize a USER/TCP\\n      interface.  The notation used is similar to most procedure or\\n      function calls in high level languages, but this usage is not\\n      meant to rule out trap type service calls (e.g., SVCs, UUOs,\\n      EMTs).\\n\\n      The user commands described below specify the basic functions the\\n      TCP must perform to support interprocess communication.\\n      Individual implementations must define their own exact format, and\\n      may provide combinations or subsets of the basic functions in\\n      single calls.  In particular, some implementations may wish to\\n      automatically OPEN a connection on the first SEND or RECEIVE\\n      issued by the user for a given connection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Page 44]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n      In providing interprocess communication facilities, the TCP must\\n      not only accept commands, but must also return information to the\\n      processes it serves.  The latter consists of:\\n\\n        (a) general information about a connection (e.g., interrupts,\\n        remote close, binding of unspecified foreign socket).\\n\\n        (b) replies to specific user commands indicating success or\\n        various types of failure.\\n\\n      Open\\n\\n        Format:  OPEN (local port, foreign socket, active/passive\\n        [, timeout] [, precedence] [, security/compartment] [, options])\\n        -> local connection name\\n\\n        We assume that the local TCP is aware of the identity of the\\n        processes it serves and will check the authority of the process\\n        to use the connection specified.  Depending upon the\\n        implementation of the TCP, the local network and TCP identifiers\\n        for the source address will either be supplied by the TCP or the\\n        lower level protocol (e.g., IP).  These considerations are the\\n        result of concern about security, to the extent that no TCP be\\n        able to masquerade as another one, and so on.  Similarly, no\\n        process can masquerade as another without the collusion of the\\n        TCP.\\n\\n        If the active/passive flag is set to passive, then this is a\\n        call to LISTEN for an incoming connection.  A passive open may\\n        have either a fully specified foreign socket to wait for a\\n        particular connection or an unspecified foreign socket to wait\\n        for any call.  A fully specified passive call can be made active\\n        by the subsequent execution of a SEND.\\n\\n        A transmission control block (TCB) is created and partially\\n        filled in with data from the OPEN command parameters.\\n\\n        On an active OPEN command, the TCP will begin the procedure to\\n        synchronize (i.e., establish) the connection at once.\\n\\n        The timeout, if present, permits the caller to set up a timeout\\n        for all data submitted to TCP.

The absence of precedence\\n        or security/compartment specification in the OPEN call indicates\\n        the default values must be used.\\n\\n        TCP will accept incoming requests as matching only if the\\n        security/compartment information is exactly the same and only if\\n        the precedence is equal to or higher than the precedence\\n        requested in the OPEN call.\\n\\n        The precedence for the connection is the higher of the values\\n        requested in the OPEN call and received from the incoming\\n        request, and fixed at that value for the life of the\\n        connection.Implementers may want to give the user control of\\n        this precedence negotiation.  For example, the user might be\\n        allowed to specify that the precedence must be exactly matched,\\n        or that any attempt to raise the precedence be confirmed by the\\n        user.\\n\\n        A local connection name will be returned to the user by the TCP.\\n        The local connection name can then be used as a short hand term\\n        for the connection defined by the <local socket, foreign socket>\\n        pair.\\n\\n      Send\\n\\n        Format:  SEND (local connection name, buffer address, byte\\n        count, PUSH flag, URGENT flag [,timeout])\\n\\n        This call causes the data contained in the indicated user buffer\\n        to be sent on the indicated connection.  If the connection has\\n        not been opened, the SEND is considered an error.  Some\\n        implementations may allow users to SEND first; in which case, an\\n        automatic OPEN would be done.  If the calling process is not\\n        authorized to use this connection, an error is returned.\\n\\n        If the PUSH flag is set, the data must be transmitted promptly\\n        to the receiver, and the PUSH bit will be set in the last TCP\\n        segment created from the buffer.  If the PUSH flag is not set,\\n        the data may be combined with data from subsequent SENDs for\\n        transmission efficiency.\\n\\n        If the URGENT flag is set, segments sent to the destination TCP\\n        will have the urgent pointer set.  The receiving TCP will signal\\n        the urgent condition to the receiving process if the urgent\\n        pointer indicates that data preceding the urgent pointer has not\\n        been consumed by the receiving process.  The purpose of urgent\\n        is to stimulate the receiver to process the urgent data and to\\n        indicate to the receiver when all the currently known urgent\\n\\n\\n[Page 46]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n        data has been received.  The number of times the sending user\\'s\\n        TCP signals urgent will not necessarily be equal to the number\\n        of times the receiving user will be notified of the presence of\\n        urgent data.\\n\\n        If no foreign socket was specified in the OPEN, but the\\n        connection is established (e.g., because a LISTENing connection\\n        has become specific due to a foreign segment arriving for the\\n        local socket), then the designated buffer is sent to the implied\\n        foreign socket.  Users who make use of OPEN with an unspecified\\n        foreign socket can make use of SEND without ever explicitly\\n        knowing the foreign socket address.\\n\\n        However, if a SEND is attempted before the foreign socket\\n        becomes specified, an error will be returned.  Users can use the\\n        STATUS call to determine the status of the connection.  In some\\n        implementations the TCP may notify the user when an unspecified\\n        socket is bound.\\n\\n        If a timeout is specified, the current user timeout for this\\n        connection is changed to the new one.\\n\\n        In the simplest implementation, SEND would not return control to\\n        the sending process until either the transmission was complete\\n        or the timeout had been exceeded.  However, this simple method\\n        is both subject to deadlocks (for example, both sides of the\\n        connection might try to do SENDs before doing any RECEIVEs) and\\n        offers poor performance, so it is not recommended.  A more\\n        sophisticated implementation would return immediately to allow\\n        the process to run concurrently with network I/O, and,\\n        furthermore, to allow multiple SENDs to be in progress.\\n        Multiple SENDs are served in first come, first served order, so\\n        the TCP will queue those it cannot service immediately.\\n\\n        We have implicitly assumed an asynchronous user interface in\\n        which a SEND later elicits some kind of SIGNAL or\\n        pseudo-interrupt from the serving TCP.  An alternative is to\\n        return a response immediately.  For instance, SENDs might return\\n        immediate local acknowledgment, even if the segment sent had not\\n        been acknowledged by the distant TCP.  We could optimistically\\n        assume eventual success.  If we are wrong, the connection will\\n        close anyway due to the timeout.  In implementations of this\\n        kind (synchronous), there will still be some asynchronous\\n        signals, but these will deal with the connection itself, and not\\n        with specific segments or buffers.\\n\\n        In order for the process to distinguish among error or success\\n        indications for different SENDs, it might be appropriate for the\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 47]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nFunctional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n        buffer address to be returned along with the coded response to\\n        the SEND request.

If no OPEN precedes this command or the\\n        calling process is not authorized to use this connection, an\\n        error is returned.\\n\\n        In the simplest implementation, control would not return to the\\n        calling program until either the buffer was filled, or some\\n        error occurred, but this scheme is highly subject to deadlocks.\\n        A more sophisticated implementation would permit several\\n        RECEIVEs to be outstanding at once.  These would be filled as\\n        segments arrive.  This strategy permits increased throughput at\\n        the cost of a more elaborate scheme (possibly asynchronous) to\\n        notify the calling program that a PUSH has been seen or a buffer\\n        filled.\\n\\n        If enough data arrive to fill the buffer before a PUSH is seen,\\n        the PUSH flag will not be set in the response to the RECEIVE.\\n        The buffer will be filled with as much data as it can hold.  If\\n        a PUSH is seen before the buffer is filled the buffer will be\\n        returned partially filled and PUSH indicated.\\n\\n        If there is urgent data the user will have been informed as soon\\n        as it arrived via a TCP-to-user signal.  The receiving user\\n        should thus be in \"urgent mode\".  If the URGENT flag is on,\\n        additional urgent data remains.  If the URGENT flag is off, this\\n        call to RECEIVE has returned all the urgent data, and the user\\n        may now leave \"urgent mode\".  Note that data following the\\n        urgent pointer (non-urgent data) cannot be delivered to the user\\n        in the same buffer with preceeding urgent data unless the\\n        boundary is clearly marked for the user.\\n\\n        To distinguish among several outstanding RECEIVEs and to take\\n        care of the case that a buffer is not completely filled, the\\n        return code is accompanied by both a buffer pointer and a byte\\n        count indicating the actual length of the data received.\\n\\n        Alternative implementations of RECEIVE might have the TCP\\n\\n\\n\\n[Page 48]                                                               \\n\\x0c\\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                           Transmission Control Protocol\\n                                                Functional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n        allocate buffer storage, or the TCP might share a ring buffer\\n        with the user.\\n\\n      Close\\n\\n        Format:  CLOSE (local connection name)\\n\\n        This command causes the connection specified to be closed.

Thus, it should be acceptable to make several SEND\\n        calls, followed by a CLOSE, and expect all the data to be sent\\n        to the destination.  It should also be clear that users should\\n        continue to RECEIVE on CLOSING connections, since the other side\\n        may be trying to transmit the last of its data.  Thus, CLOSE\\n        means \"I have no more to send\" but does not mean \"I will not\\n        receive any more.\"  It may happen (if the user level protocol is\\n        not well thought out) that the closing side is unable to get rid\\n        of all its data before timing out.  In this event, CLOSE turns\\n        into ABORT, and the closing TCP gives up.\\n\\n        The user may CLOSE the connection at any time on his own\\n        initiative, or in response to various prompts from the TCP\\n        (e.g., remote close executed, transmission timeout exceeded,\\n        destination inaccessible).\\n\\n        Because closing a connection requires communication with the\\n        foreign TCP, connections may remain in the closing state for a\\n        short time.

One case is that of the ARPA\\n    internetwork system where the lower level module is the Internet\\n    Protocol (IP) [2].\\n\\n    If the lower level protocol is IP it provides arguments for a type\\n    of service and for a time to live.  TCP uses the following settings\\n    for these parameters:\\n\\n      Type of Service = Precedence: routine, Delay: normal, Throughput:\\n      normal, Reliability: normal; or 00000000.\\n\\n      Time to Live    = one minute, or 00111100.\\n\\n        Note that the assumed maximum segment lifetime is two minutes.\\n        Here we explicitly ask that a segment be destroyed if it cannot\\n        be delivered by the internet system within one minute.\\n\\n    If the lower level is IP (or other protocol that provides this\\n    feature) and source routing is used, the interface must allow the\\n    route information to be communicated.  This is especially important\\n    so that the source and destination addresses used in the TCP\\n    checksum be the originating source and ultimate destination. It is\\n    also important to preserve the return route to answer connection\\n    requests.\\n\\n    Any lower level protocol will have to provide the source address,\\n    destination address, and protocol fields, and some way to determine\\n    the \"TCP length\", both to provide the functional equivlent service\\n    of IP and to be used in the TCP checksum.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                               [Page 51]\\n\\x0c\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nFunctional Specification\\n\\n\\n\\n3.9.  Event Processing\\n\\n  The processing depicted in this section is an example of one possible\\n  implementation.  Other implementations may have slightly different\\n  processing sequences, but they should differ from those in this\\n  section only in detail, not in substance.\\n\\n  The activity of the TCP can be characterized as responding to events.\\n  The events that occur can be cast into three categories:  user calls,\\n  arriving segments, and timeouts.  This section describes the\\n  processing the TCP does in response to each of the events.  In many\\n  cases the processing required depends on the state of the connection.\\n\\n    Events that occur:\\n\\n      User Calls\\n\\n        OPEN\\n        SEND\\n        RECEIVE\\n        CLOSE\\n        ABORT\\n        STATUS\\n\\n      Arriving Segments\\n\\n        SEGMENT ARRIVES\\n\\n      Timeouts\\n\\n        USER TIMEOUT\\n        RETRANSMISSION TIMEOUT\\n        TIME-WAIT TIMEOUT\\n\\n  The model of the TCP/user interface is that user commands receive an\\n  immediate return and possibly a delayed response via an event or\\n  pseudo interrupt.  In the following descriptions, the term \"signal\"\\n  means cause a delayed response.\\n\\n  Error responses are given as character strings.  For example, user\\n  commands referencing connections that do not exist receive \"error:\\n  connection not open\".\\n\\n  Please note in the following that all arithmetic on sequence numbers,\\n  acknowledgment numbers, windows, et cetera, is modulo 2**32 the size\\n  of the sequence number space.
